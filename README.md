## About the Video Course
Big data analytics are driving innovations in scientific research, digital marketing, policy-making and much more. Matplotlib offers a simple but powerful plotting interface, versatile plot types, and robust customization. Python Data Visualization with Matplotlib 2.x illustrates the methods and applications of various plot types through real-world examples. It begins by giving the viewers the basic know-how on how to create and customize plots by Matplotlib. It further covers how to plot different types of economic data in the form of 2D and 3D graphs, which supply insights from a deluge of data from public repositories, such as Quandl Finance. You will learn to visualize geographical data on maps and implement interactive charts. By the end of this course, you will be well versed with Matplotlib in your day-to-day work to perform advanced data visualization. This book will guide you to prepare high-quality figures for manuscripts and presentations. You will learn to create intuitive info-graphics and reshape your message crisply understandable.
